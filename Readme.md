# AoM grid layout hotkeys, compatible with [the Expanded Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=1828492742)

**WARNING**: The layout is incomplete. It implements most of the Greek, Egyptian and Norse hotkeys, and partially Atlantean. The only language supported is english.

If the unit training building can train more than 5 type of units, the units 6, 7 etc. can be trained by combination alt-q, alt-w etc.

The `DefaultKeyMap2.8.xml` file includes the configuration of the default hotkeys.

## To make these hotkeys work:

- ### Copy DefaultKeyMap2.8.xml to the Expanded Mod Core directory

for Windows (most likely):

`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Age of Mythology\mods\Expanded Mod Core\data\DefaultKeyMap2.8.xml`

for Linux:

`~/.steam/steam/steamapps/common/Age of Mythology/mods/Expanded Mod Core/data/DefaultKeyMap2.8.xml`

- ### Open AoM and reset the keybindings to default

After doing this you should be able to change the keybindings directly in AoM settings, the new ones should be shown in the ui.

If not, you may just edit the `DefaultKeyMap2.8.xml` in the mod directory
